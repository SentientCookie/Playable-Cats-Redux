  "description" : "I've officially taken over the Playable Cats species mod. All updates to the Playable Cats mod by TheBlueLeafeon will be here.\n\n\n---SPECIAL THANKS---\n\n\nSkittles for the Race Template Mod.\nTheAdmiral for the idea and renaming all those files in the TheAdmiral's Play as a Cat!! mod.\nRylasasin for their work on the fall damage modifier patch made for the original Playable Cats that this mod has now incorporated!\nTheBlueLeafeon for all of their work thus far in making this mod possible!\n\n\n---DESCRIPTION---\n\n\nThe base files in this mod are an exact copy of TheBlueLeafeon's original Playable Cats mod and thus will not be compatible with it.\n\nThe default ship is the Hylotl ship, which probably won't change at this time so as to not break anyone's ship files.\nThe alternative Avian ship still works [confirmed by TheBlueLeafeon] with this mod since all of the base mod files are the same as the original: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=777985208\n\nIn order to use this mod, you absolutely MUST have some kind of race extender mod installed. It doesn't matter which race extender you use; you just need one. This is a popular one that many people use: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729573883\n\nAdditionally, the Siamese body sprite has been merged into this mod as the \"female\" body.\nFor those whose female characters are broken from this change or if you simply hate the new sprite, please use this patch here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&id=1302252128\n\nSeveral new fur colors, eye colors, and secondary fur colors have been added [including the requested purple color].\n\nThis mod also includes invisible clothing, custom (invisible) armor, tiered cat swords, a custom ship pet, a custom flag item, and a handful of custom NPCs.\n\nFor now, most of the npcs need to be spawned in with the /spawnnpc command.\nThis mod also fixes errors that TheAdmiral's Play as a Cat!! mod put into the starbound.log file.\n\nFalling damage is reduced for this species only; it no longer affects other races.\n\n\n---DISCLAIMERS, PERMISSIONS, AND PLANNED FEATURES---\n\n\nI do not intend on making a custom ship at this time. Because this mod is supported in the [OFFICIAL] FU BYOS Modded Race Support, I probably won't make a custom ship at this time. However, if anyone else wants to make one as an addon to this mod, feel free to do so; just let me know so that I can link to it here. I may eventually do one, but I have other things I want to get done first.\n\nI am planning on eventually trying to make custom collar armors and/or body patterns as clothing/armor at some point in the future. I'd also like to either make some hats or try to get existing vanilla hats to work with the species by modifying the head offset.\n\nFuture plans so far: Codex entries, tweaks to npc dialogue, more default names, actual lore and background to the species, probably dungeons/villiages, some kind of custom clothing, tenants, and several other things that I can't think of right now.\n\nOn a side-note, I've spent several days attempting to make more fur patterns for the cat in the character creation menu as a type of \"hair\", but It's not working as it should, so that's not going to happen.\n\n\n---BUGS AND CRASHING---\n\n\nI play as a cat in my own starbound file, so if there are any problems directly with my mod in vanilla or even Frackin' Universe, I would probably find them. However, with so many mods out there, it's nearly impossible to make them compatible with everything. If you find an error or have the game crash on you, I would require your Starbound.log file. You'll need to paste the full log into pastebin [or another equivalent site] and post the link here. I cannot help you otherwise.\n\nSometimes Steam likes to be a butt and not completely install downloaded mods. If you're getting crashes, please hit the Unsubscribe and then hit Subscribe to redownload it. Sometimes, that's all it takes to fix certain errors.\n\n\n---INCOMPATIBILITIES---\n\n\nOlder versions of A.V.A.I.N. cause this mod to crash. That is a problem with their mod, not mine. I heard they fixed it though.\n\nThis is a custom race mod, and as such, will not be compatible with servers that aren't custom-species friendly.\n\nThe Xenormorph Mod by The Admiral still uses all the base \"cat\" file names and folders, so it will cause issues if used together with this mod. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755013863\n\n\n---UPDATES---\n\n\n[Check the Change Notes tab for all version update notes]",
